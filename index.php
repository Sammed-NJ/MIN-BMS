        The big screen. There’s something to be said about watching visual storytelling on a three-story screen, particularly when the film really takes advantage of the format. Just think of what it’s like to see the Millennium Falcon jump into hyperspace in <span>The Force Awakens</span> , or the loving long takes near bodies of water in <span>Moonlight</span>. It’s tempting to think that sitting in a dark theater staring at a massive white sheet won’t matter when everyone has 40-plus-inch 4K TVs, but scale has a unique ability to sweep you away. You get pulled into the sound and color in a way that you don’t feel when you’re sitting on your couch at home. There’s nothing inherently wrong with watching Star Wars on your phone, tablet, laptop, or TV. It’s just that seeing something cinematic blown up big for the eyes to feast on is still a unique, worthwhile experience.
